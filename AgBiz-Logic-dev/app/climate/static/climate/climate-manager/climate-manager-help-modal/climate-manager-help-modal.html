           Seasonal Climate Forecast or Future Climate Projection: Which Should You Choose?

        With <i>AgBizClimate</i>, you can do two things. First, with the Seasonal Climate Forecast,
        you can explore whether to expect warmer or cooler or wetter or drier conditions during
        the next several months. With that information, you can estimate how your yields and operations
        may respond to such weather conditions in the coming months and view the effects on your net returns.
        Secondly, with the Future Climate Projection, you can step into the climate of 20–30 years
        from present to consider how your current enterprises and operations will continue to serve
        you under future average conditions that may be different from what you’ve experienced in the past.

        <p><p>

        Seasonal Climate Forecast can support you with decisions you’ll make for the current year’s crop
        to maximize net returns. Future Climate Projection can support you with long-range planning decisions
        you may want to begin considering now in order to maintain profitable operations 20-30 years from now.

        <p>

        The next steps for both Seasonal Climate Forecast and Future Climate Projection is to use <i>AgBizProfit</i>
        to explore adaptations that could mitigate potential net losses during the current season, or that could
        sustain profitable operations decades into the future.

        Climate prediction: A climate prediction or climate forecast is the result of an attempt
        to produce (starting from a particular state of the climate system) an estimate of the actual
        evolution of the climate in the future, for example, at seasonal, interannual, or decadal time scales.
        Because the future evolution of the climate system may be highly sensitive to initial conditions,
        such predictions are usually probabilistic in nature.

        Climate projection: A climate projection is the simulated response of the climate system
        to a scenario of future emission or concentration of greenhouse gases and aerosols,
        generally derived using climate models. Climate projections are distinguished from
        climate predictions by their dependence on the emission/concentration/radiative forcing
        scenario used, which is in turn based on assumptions concerning, for example, future
        socioeconomic and technological developments that may or may not be realized.
