The climate metric was computed on each 4km by 4km grid box and averaged across historical and future time periods for two representative concentration pathways (RCP): RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 (Van Vuuren et al. 2011). These climate metrics were already available on the Northwest Climate Toolbox website. (climatetoolbox.org)I downloaded the gridded climate metrics from climatetoolbox.org and averaged all pixels within each county in the continental United States for the historical baseline (1971–2000) layer and the low and high emissions futures layers (2010–2039). I converted the units from metric to standard where applicable.Units:Temperature-based metrics: degrees FahrenheitPrecipitation-based metrics: inches-----------------------------------------DATA-SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR ALL FILES-----------------------------------------1.
