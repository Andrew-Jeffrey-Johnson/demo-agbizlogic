IN NO EVENT WILL OSU’S TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO ABL EXCEED THE LESSER OF THE TOTAL SUM OF FEES PAYABLE TO OSU UNDER THESE ABL TERMS OF USE FOR THE 12 MONTHS PRECEDING THE ACTION GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM, OR THE LIMITS OF THE OREGON CONSTITUTION, ARTICLE XI, § 7 AND THE OREGON TORT CLAIMS ACT (ORS

          <li>The laws of the State of Oregon (without giving effect to its conflicts of law principles) govern all matters arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use, including, without limitation, its validity, interpretation, construction, performance, and enforcement. Any claim, action, suit or proceeding (collectively, “Proceeding”) between You and OSU arising from or related to Your use of ABL, shall be brought and conducted solely and exclusively within the Circuit Court of the State of Oregon for Benton County; provided, however, if a Proceeding must be brought in a federal forum, then unless otherwise prohibited by law, it shall be brought and conducted solely and exclusively within the United States District Court for the District of Oregon.

          <li>Miscellaneous: All rights and obligations under these ABL Terms of Use intended by their nature to survive termination of this agreement, such as confidentiality obligations, survive the termination of this agreement. If a court of competent jurisdiction finds any part of these ABL Terms of Use are unenforceable, then that part of the Terms of Use will be enforced to the maximum extent possible so as to effect the intent of the parties and the validity of the remaining Terms of Use shall not be affected. You and OSU are the only parties to these ABL Terms of Use and are the only parties entitled to enforce its terms; there are no intended beneficiaries of these AgBiz Logic Terms of Use.</li>
