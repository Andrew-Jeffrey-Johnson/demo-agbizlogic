This is the project file structure for each Django app/module in the AgBiz Logic application. Each app/module has only
one template which serves as the entry point where the Angular client application is loaded and run. The Angular client
consumes the RESTful API built in the 'views' directory. All HTML is rendered client-side, allowing complete separation
of the RESTful API backend and the UI. The Angular application is built using components; each component has an
associated JavaScript, HTML, and optional CSS file, as well as a view object file which is used for end-to-end tests
with Protractor.
